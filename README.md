# Classification

This project implements a data generator to produce two class dataset, and compare the relationship among dataset, rule and results.

## Environment

* OS: Ubuntu 16.04
* Pyhton version: 2.7.12
* Library: Numpy, Scipy, sklean

## Files & Directory

* datagen.py

    API for generating data. Each class has number of independent variables, which are called *characteristics*.
    Characteristics are passed as parameters to functions and generate *features*, which are probably dependent.
    Currently, all functions are polynomial. 

* classifier.py

    Load data generated by datagen.py, test data with the specific model and return the confusion matrix finally.

* experiment.py

    Some experiments related to dataset, (rule) functions and results of decision tree and random forest.

* result.txt

    Stdout of python experiment.py

* npz/

    Data used to generate the result.txt.
    
##  Command

    python -u experiment.py | tee result.txt
